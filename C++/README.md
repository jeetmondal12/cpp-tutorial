## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (MinGW GCC)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Compilation
The repository includes VS Code tasks for compilation. Use the built-in build task or compile manually using:
```bash
gcc -g filename.cpp -o filename.exe
```

## Usage
Each directory contains standalone cpp files that can be compiled and run independently. The code is well-commented to explain the concepts and implementation details.

## Learning Path
1. Start with the basics in `02-Basics`
2. Progress through control structures (conditionals and loops)
3. Learn functions and arrays
4. Move on to more complex topics like file handling and structures
5. Study STL and advanced concepts
6. Practice with LeetCode problems

Feel free to explore the code examples and modify them to enhance your understanding of C++ programming concepts.
